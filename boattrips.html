        <h1>Grama Bay Tour DAILY TRIP</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> Grammata Beach is located at the foot of the western slope of Karaburun Peninsula, in the Bay of Grama, which has long served as place of refuge for ships fleeing storms. In ancient times, this bay was used for stone quarrying, traces of which are still visible in the form of dramatic cliffs. “Grammata” comes from the Greek world for “letters” (which is also the source of the word “grammar”). This is no coincidence, as ancient sailors and quarry workers have left thousands of inscriptions with their names.</p>
        <h3>Trip details</h3>
        <p>  The boat departs from the small pier in the centre of Himare to Grama Bay every day. It takes approximately 2-2.5 hours to reach the destination. Along the way, you can stop for photos and swimming in the beautiful local blue caves and bays between Himara and Grammata Beach, including Pigeon's Cave, Gjipe Beach, Pirate's Cave, Drymades beach, Palasa beach, the Thunder Cave, and the unique Saint Andreas bay. We typically spend around 1-1.5 hours at Grama, and the return trip to Himara takes about 1 hour.</p>
        <h3>Duration</h3>
        <p>The total duration of the trip is around 5 hours with 4 stops for swimming and many stops for photos!</p>
        <h3>Price</h3>
        <p> 6000 ALL/person </p>
        <h3>Important info</h3>
        <p> The meeting point is at our stand on the Himara main beach called “Himara Seas The Day” boat trips. At Grama Beach there is a small taverna, however we recommend you to bring your own water, snacks, towels, sunscreen, snorkel etc.
        To avoid any inconvenience, please contact us the day you intend to travel so we can let you know about the weather conditions and starting time (contact details +355 69 897 4846 / +355697773427 whatsapp)</p>
